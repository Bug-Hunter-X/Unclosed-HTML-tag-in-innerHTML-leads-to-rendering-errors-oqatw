This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to unclosed tags within innerHTML assignments. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in an incomplete HTML structure. The `solution.html` file provides the corrected code using proper string concatenation or DOM manipulation techniques to avoid this issue. This is a common pitfall when dynamically modifying HTML content, often leading to unexpected rendering issues and difficulties in debugging.  Ensure all HTML tags are properly closed for consistent and predictable results.
